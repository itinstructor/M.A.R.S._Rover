# M.A.R.S.-Rover
The 4tronix Mars Rover is loosely based on the Curiosity and Mars 2020 rovers from NASA. It uses the same rocker arm, bogey and differential arm mechanism.

### Purpose
I am an Information Technology Instructor at Western Nebraska Community College. I teach Information Technology Technical Support, CyberSecurity and Computer Science.
Who can ever have enough robots? Who doesn't want their own MARS Rover?

### Changes
- 01/01/2021: The robot was designed for a Raspberry Pi Zero. I put in a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. It takes more voltage than the 4 onboard AA rechargeble batteries can put out. I added a small phone charger battery directly to the Pi. Created a Tkinter GUI.
